index_samplingRate_type_frequency_duration_amplitude_windowType_windowLength


index           = 'i' + integer of soundboard memory bank to use
samplingRate    = of the soundBoard playback in Hz
type            = [sine, uniform, gaussian, periodic] if not sine it's the 
                  random distribution form which the white noise was created
frequency       = tone frequency in Hz or "None" for white noise
duration        = sound duration in seconds
amplitude       = sound amplitude from 0 - 1
windowType      = [hanning, hamming, blackman] shape of the kernel for fade in 
                  and out
windowLength    = length of fade window applied to the sound in seconds
